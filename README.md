# Shortest Path Through Obstacles

This project utilizes Python and Java to use a GUI to display the shortest path through a grid of obstacles. If there is a way from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right, the script will display the optimal path while avoiding obstacles. If there is no possible path, that will be displayed as well. All cells can be travelled to from the 8 directionally adjacent cells (up/down, left/right, and up/downleft/right diagonally).

## Python Script Usage Instructions

  1. Input an 2D array at the bottom of the script.
  2. Run the script.
  3. The GUI window will display a grid with obstacles.
  4. The optimal path, if found, will be displayed in green.
  5. If the end position cannot be reached, the obstacle course will be displayed in red.
  

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- [Tkinter](https://pypi.org/project/tk-tools/)(usually included with Python)
- [collections](https://pypi.org/project/collections/) (usually included with Python)

You can install them using:

    pip install tk-tools

## Java Script Usage Instructions
1. Input an 2D array in the main function of the script.
2. Run the script.
3. The GUI window will display a grid with obstacles.
4. The optimal path, if found, will be displayed in green.
5. If the end position cannot be reached, the obstacle course will be displayed in red.
